GSQL parser generated by tree-sitter. Compiled to WASM.

## Requirement
#### 1. `node` and `npm`
Main development platform.

#### 2. `emcc`
Is used to compile C to wasm.
```
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git ~/emsdk
cd ~/emsdk
git checkout 2.0.17
```
Then follow https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk

__Make sure to use emcc@2.0.17__ Other versions will generate incorrect tree-sitter WASM.

`emcc` uses Python3.6 syntax (f string), make sure `python` in your shell points to a Python3.6+ installation.

If on ubuntu, see https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-9-on-ubuntu-20-04/

If doesn't work, see https://askubuntu.com/questions/1152640/apt-install-doesnt-install-python3-6


#### 3. Optional
If you are on `Windows`, run this in an admin shell.
```
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```
for native binding support.
